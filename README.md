## Goal
Make it easy to preview scores 
Win more gold stake runs.

## Use cases
- Experiment with exotic builds even when not playing
- Play Balatro with it open

## Tech Stack
- React
- Typescript
- Zustand
- Lodash

## Features planned
Shooting for the moon here. Right now the functionality is limited to a handful of simple jokers.
The goal is to support most scoring jokers and to even support calculating probability distributions.

Misprint, Bloodstone, etc. introduce probabilistic scoring.

## Non-Goals
- Not intended to be a full balatro sim. Buy the game!
- Handling all joker interactions outside of a round score.


## Development
Pretty straightforward. Using yarn v4. 
Get started by running `yarn & yarn dev`
Other scripts listed in the `package.json`
